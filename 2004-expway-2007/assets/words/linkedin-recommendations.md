I like to call him "Google is my Friend".
Because he is like Google: fast thinking, reliable and always aware of the latest technologies.
An other characteristic is his strong attraction to the open source world.

I've been really impressed by Eric's general knowledge level and analysis skills. Beside his very professional behavior, I would say that Eric is as efficient and organised as Java and XML are.
