Title: Web 2.0 Developer
Employment type: Freelance
Company name: Vodafone
Location: Düsseldorf, Germany
Start date: February 2008
End date: April 2008
Description:
End-customer: Vodafone Global, in Düsseldorf (Germany)

I was hired by ITHR Consulting, in charge of the Vodafone portal development and support, to be part of the Prototype team. I was actually half of the team during three months, and had a great experience working in a duet with a true American Entrepreneur.

I worked on a super secret project I can tell nothing about, except that it involved a mobile phone :) and I really enjoyed developing new concepts and sharing weird ideas. The main requirement was thinking out of the box and exploring a wide range of technologies:
  - RSS
  - Yahoo! Pipes
  - script.aculo.us
  - Facebook
  - Google Maps
