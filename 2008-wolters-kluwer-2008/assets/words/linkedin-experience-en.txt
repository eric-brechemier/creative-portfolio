Description:
Problem Solved ▶︎ After the acquisition of Lamy France,
Wolters Kluwer wished to migrate their suite of Web portals
for professionals from PHP to Java, to conform to the technology
stack selected by the global corporation. To prepare this migration,
Wolters Kluwer required to analyze and document the existing systems
using UML.

Solutions ▶︎▶︎ I analyzed the PHP code of Web application modules currently
deployed on WK-Pharma portal in order to produce Use Case documents and
UML diagrams. I also created a poster with a bird-level overview of the
whole system architecture. These diagrams helped the different teams of
Wolters Kluwer to gain a better understanding of everything that was there.
Having observed a lower performance for the first portal migrated from PHP
to Java, and now realizing the scale of the full scope of work, the migration
was halted. The knowledge gained from the diagrams I produced helped to avoid
a costly and unnecessary migration. The newly created documentation also helped
to improve the maintenance and evolutions of the existing PHP portals.
