# Creative Portfolio of Eric Br√©chemier,<br>Instructional Designer (Art & Creation)

## I help students to learn artistic and creative skills.

Designer and technologist, I help children and adult learners
to experience beauty through art and creation to develop their
ability to see, to picture and to create.

After having worked for 15 years as a Software Engineer while
studying Graphic Design as a self-learner, I initiated a transition
towards Instructional Design in 2019.

This transition accelerated through the explosion of resources made
available since the start of the pandemic to face the growing challenges
of Education. I started my learning journey with a focus on online learning
for children and adult learners. A highlight of this journey was my completion
of Connie Malamed's Instructional Design Masterclass at the beginning of 2021.

Ongoing experience of homeschooling with our two sons, aged 6 and 11, as
well as volunteer work with two organizations, [Art Explora][] in France and
[Art History Link-Up][AHLU] in the UK, have led me to steer in a new direction.
I have now chosen to specialize in the design of instruction for art and
creation across all modalities, from face to face to distance learning.
