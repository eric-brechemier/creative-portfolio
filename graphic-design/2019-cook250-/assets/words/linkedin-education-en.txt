Description:
Problem: Design a poster to raise awareness for a cause, a country or
region that matters to you.

I have designed a poster which confronts a European perspective and a
Māori perspective on the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of the
arrival of James Cook in New Zealand. The poster aims to raise awareness
on several levels:

1. the Māori settled New Zealand 500 years
   before James Cook "discovered" it,
2. the scientific exploration of James Cook
   was associated with gratuitous violence,
3. murderers are now celebrated while their
   victims have remained largely unknown.
