# Best App – Individual/SME

## Oct 2011
### ITU

The "7 Days Gallery" application that I developed in a creative collaboration with artist Alève Mine has received a Best App award in the Individual/Small Medium Enterprise category at ITU Telecom World 2011.

We shared a $5,000 cash prize which financed among other things a TV set to test new developments.
