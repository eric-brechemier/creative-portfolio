Title: Web Application Developer
Employment type: Permanent
Company name: LegalBox
Location: Paris, France
Start date: March 2010
End date: July 2011
Description:
I started on March 3rd 2010 with the very first employees of Legal-Box. One year later, we have released the first commercial version of the web application, a webmail with legal value, to send registered letters online.

I chose to make the application very modular: each visual block was developed in an autonomous Git project, tested in isolation.

In each Git project:
- Ant scripts for the build process using JSLint to check the code and YUI Compressor to minify it for release
- unit tests using the test runner of bezen.org JavaScript library
- HTML API documentation generated by Natural Docs.

My favorite parts of the application development were:
- design and development of The Scalable JavaScript Application framework, released as open source on GitHub
- local navigation preserved in browser history (back button)
- support for internationalization (i18n) based on HTML templates
