Helping warehouse management software to grow in new directions

Problem Solved ▶︎ Two branches of code which had diverged several years ago had to be reconciled. On one branch, a migration to a new version of Delphi and a new database system, which was not completed. On the other branch, the production code had evolved independently, with the addition and removal of different features.

Solutions ▶︎▶︎
1. I introduced a new workflow based on git and GitHub for versioning of the source code,
2. I used git diff and git add tools in interactive mode to recreate a gradual history of the project,
3. I completed the initial migration with the help of command line transformations using grep and sed.
