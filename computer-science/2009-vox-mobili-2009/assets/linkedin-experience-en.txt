Description:
End-customer: Voxmobili, in Paris (France)

I worked on the backend of two web platforms to be delivered to telco operators
in 2009. The development was done in Java and SQL, using Eclipse. I designed
independent components with UML, as well as SQL tables for an Oracle database.

Specific developments included:
- the adapter module to send/receive SMS from telco's Gateway server
- server modules connected through Web services to telco Gateway server
  for import, synchronization and matching of social network contacts
- a back-end module for the migration of users part of the platform deployment
