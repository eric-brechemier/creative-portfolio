# Jean-NoÃ«l Heyraud

## February 6, 2019

Eric is the essential guy. He listens, understands and questions. He is incredibly open-minded and super pragmatic.
His technical culture and skills are outstanding.
He likes taking up challenges, always contributes to have an inspiring atmosphere and suggests appropriate and evolutive solutions.

At eGull, he was the cornerstone of our backend infrastructure and I have to admit that its rosbutness, liability and scalability are 100% attributable to Eric.
