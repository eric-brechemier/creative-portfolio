Description:
Helping casual golfers to play more often

Problems Solved ▶︎ Hired as first employee of eGull in June 2015, I have gone through the different phases of its development, with several pivots:
1. analysis of movements recorded by smartwatch sensors to detect golf shots
2. tracking of GPS positions of golfers to reduce congestion on golf courses
3. flexible payment for golf rounds, based on the number of holes played

Solutions ▶︎▶︎ I attacked these three problems from the perspective of data recording, processing, and extraction of patterns and knowledge. I put the database at the core of our architecture, using a thin middle layer that bridges the communication between HTTP requests and SQL queries, and handles token-based authentication.
