### Project description

mangaconseil.com is a Web 2.0 site about mangas (Japanese graphic novels).

I designed the information architecture and the tools to update the website using a simple spreadsheet as a backend and XSLT transformations powered with Saxon and Ant to generate a local database in XML and JSON formats.

I developed the whole application in client-side JavaScript. The most challenging parts were the search engine and the recommendation engine.
