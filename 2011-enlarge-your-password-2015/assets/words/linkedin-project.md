# Enlarge Your Password!

## Mar 2011 â€“ Mar 2015

### Project Description

This is a very simple web app, designed for everyday use. The goal is to generate a strong password to access a web site by filling in a form with simple yet unique information. All inputs are optional and the password is generated on the fly, which lets the user choose the level of details to get more or less security. The same password is generated consistently for the same inputs.
